# OCR Project to Recognize Character From Picture using Android Camera Integration
### Android Version (10), API 29

During Covid-19, document management, especially birth certificate documents, was done online. The community fills in the data form and uploads photos of the complete documents. The Registry Officer then verifies the uploaded documents and the data filled in. This verification process tends to be long and inefficient because it has to be done manually. By using machine learning, namely Optical Character Recognition (OCR), you can easily extract data and match it with user input. This OCR can also be applied to a wider range of applications.

## Here the documentation of the Aplication.

## Important 
This application has just arrived at the design stage of taking pictures and updating the UI and still in development. The problem that has not been resolved is how to connect firebase with apps so that the captured images can be directly uploaded to firebase and validated.
